Thank you for your attention.

This is an educational Python program and I recreated the classic Snake Game everyone knows ;-)

The commands are the arrows, which will try to change the snake direction to the same as the arrow.

Try to get as many foods as you can. The highest score will be saved in the 'highest_score.txt' and can be changed any
time (No cheating, huh? ;-) )

If you have any suggestions, send a direct message to my Twitter @baiocco_igor

I really hope you enjoy it!
